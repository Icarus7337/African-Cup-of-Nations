The slider bar can be used to access details of the African Cup of Nations, held biennially, over the period 1978-1994.

The legend shows differentiating characteristics between the host, champion and runner up nation. The key has been picked to allow easy spotting even in case of overlapping scenarios (if the host nation is also the winner or runner up).

On clicking the nations, the view is zoomed in to show the country in focus. When the host nation is clicked, a button appears offering to zoom to the stadium where the final match was played.
